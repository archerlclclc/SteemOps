# SteemOps
***Steemit***: Advancements in distributed ledger technologies are driving the rise of blockchain-based social media platforms such as *Steemit*, where users interact with each other in similar ways as conventional social networks. 
***SteemOps***: *SteemOps* is a dataset that organizes over 900 million operations from Steemit into three sub-datasets: 1) social-network operation dataset (SOD); 2) witness-election operation dataset (WOD); 3) value-tansfer operation dataset (VOD). We collect over 38 million blocks generated in Steemit during a 45 month time period from 2016/03 to 2019/11 and extract ten key types of operations performed by the users.
