# SteemOps
## Steemit
Advancements in distributed ledger technologies are driving the rise of blockchain-based social media platforms such as [*Steemit*](https://steemit.com/), where users interact with each other in similar ways as conventional social networks. 

## SteemOps: a well-processed dataset for Steemit
We collect over 38 million blocks generated in *Steemit* during a 45 month time period from 2016/03 to 2019/11 and extract ten key types of operations performed by the users.
The results generate *SteemOps*, a new dataset that organizes over 900 million operations from *Steemit* into three sub-datasets:

- **social-network operation dataset (SOD)**: comment, vote, custom_json;

- **witness-election operation dataset (WOD)**: witness_update, witness_vote, witness_proxy;

- **value-tansfer operation dataset (VOD)**: transfer, transfer_to_vesting, delegate_vesting_shares, withdraw_vesting.
